        Robusta is a statistics package in Python 3, aimed at providing
        accsess to many frequent statistical tests and tools. The statistical
        analyses are performed throgh a high-level interface with the R language,
        using [RPY2](https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2).  
        
        Robusta includes a variety of frequent statistical tests and tools used in the 
        academia and industry (most come both with 
            frequentist and Bayesian implementation):
        - Correlation coefficients - Pearson, Spearman, Kendell, $`\chi^2`$, 
            part and partial correlation
        - T-tests - one sample, paired/unpaired samples, Welch, Wilcoxon  
        - Anova - between, within, mixed, Kruskall-Wallis, Friedman
        - Linear and logistic regression 
        - Mixed-Effects Models (Coming soon)
        
        
        Along the statistical tools, robusta offers several tools which are
        useful for quickly producing publication-ready reports:
        - Plain text 
        - LaTex formatted   
        - ?
        
        The plotting functions of robusta include inferential and descriptive plots,
        including:
        - Bayesian sequential analysis plots (inspired by 
        [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/))
        - Bayesian posterior distribution plots 
        - Marginal effect plots
        - Correlogram
