        Robusta is a statistics package in Python3 providing an interface to 
        many common statistical analyses, performed using through [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
        using [RPY2](https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2).  
        
        Robusta is currently under development 
        
        Robusta includes a variety of frequent statistical tests and tools used in the 
        academia and industry (most come both with 
            frequentist and Bayesian implementation):
        - Correlation coefficients - Pearson, Spearman, Kendell, $`\chi^2`$, 
            part and partial correlation
        - T-tests - one sample, paired/unpaired samples, Welch, Wilcoxon  
        - Anova - between, within, mixed, Kruskall-Wallis, Friedman
        - Linear and logistic regression 
        - Mixed-Effects Models (Coming soon)
