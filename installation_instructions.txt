# Recipe for installation:
conda create -n rst_tst python=3.7 # r-essentials r-base
conda activate rst_tst
# conda install -c r rpy2 # Can't install with pip

# conda doesn't have the most recent setuptools and then we can't find
# pytest for some reason, so we also need to run:
pip install setuptools
# then CD to where setup.py is and run
pip install -e .
